[{"heading":"(0%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"A Treatise on Initiations; or Asclepios  Hermes Trismegistos PART I. Hermes:  It is a God who hath brought thee to us, Asclepios, that thou mayst assist at a divine discourse, and one which will be the most truly religious of all we have as yet held, or with which we have been inspired from on high. In understanding it thou wilt be in possession of all blessings, if so be indeed there are several, and if it be not more correct to say there is but one blessing which comprises all."},{"heading":"(0%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"For each one of them is bound to another; all are derived from one and make but one, so that their mutual bonds make separation impossible. This is what thou wilt understand by paying attention to that which we are about to say. But first, Asclepios, go away for a little while and look for another hearer for our discourse. [Asclepios proposes to call Ammon.] There is no objection to Ammon’s presence among us, says Trismegistos."},{"heading":"(0%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"I have not forgotten that I have addressed to him, as to a dear son, several writings on Nature and other subjects relating to exoteric teaching. But it is thy name, Asclepios, which I shall inscribe at the head of the present treatise. And call no other person than Ammon. For a discourse upon the holiest matters of religion would be profaned by a too numerous audience. It is an impiety to deliver to the knowledge of a great number, a treatise full of divine majesty."},{"heading":"(10%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"[Ammon enters the sanctuary, and completes the holy quartet,  filled with the presence of God. The invitation to devotional silence comes from the lips of Hermes, and in the presence of the attentive souls who hang upon his words, the divine Love thus begins: ]  Every human soul, Asclepios, is immortal; but this immortality is not uniform. It differs both in mode and in duration. Asclepios:  It is because souls, Trismegistos, are not all of the same quality."},{"heading":"(10%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"Hermes:  How quickly thou understandest the reason of things, Asclepios! I have not yet said that all is one and that one is all, since all things were in the Creator before the creation and we can call Him all since all things are His members. Wherefore, throughout all this discourse, bear in mind Him who is One and All, the Creator of all things."},{"heading":"(10%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"Everything descends from heaven upon the earth, into the water, into the air: only fire is vivifying, because it tends upwards; that which tends downwards is subordinate to it. That which descends from above is generative; that which emanates and rises is nutritive. The earth, alone self-supported, is the receptacle of all things, and reconstructs the types which she receives."},{"heading":"(10%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"That Universal Being which contains all and which is all, puts into motion the soul and the world, all that nature comprises. In the manifold unity of universal life, the innumerable individualities distinguished by their variations, are, nevertheless, united in such a manner  that the whole is one, and that everything proceeds from unity. Now this unity, which constitutes the world, is formed of four elements: fire, water, earth, and air: one single world, one single soul, and one single God."},{"heading":"(10%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"Lend me now all the powers and all the penetration of thy thought; for the idea of Divinity, which cannot be conceived save by divine assistance, resembles a rapid stream precipitating itself onwards with impetuosity, and often, therefore, outstrips the attention of the listeners, and even of him who teaches. PART II. Heaven God manifest regulates all bodies. Their growth and their decline are determined by the sun and the moon."},{"heading":"(10%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"But He who directs heaven the soul itself and all that exists in the world is very God, the Creator. From the heights where He reigns descend innumerable influences which spread themselves throughout the world, into all souls both general and particular, and into the nature of things. The world has been prepared by God in order to receive all particular forms. Realising these forms by means of Nature, He has updrawn the world to heaven through the four elements."},{"heading":"(10%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"Everything is in accordance with the designs of God; but that which originates from on high has been separated into individualities in the following manner. The types of all things follow their (representative) individualities in such way that the type is a whole; the individual is a part of the type. Thus the Gods constitute a type, the genii also. Similarly, men, birds, and all beings which the world contains, constitute types producing individuals resembling them."},{"heading":"(10%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"There is yet another type, without sensation, but not without soul. It consists of those beings which sustain themselves by means of roots fixed in the earth. Individualities of this type are found everywhere. Heaven is full of God. The types of which we have spoken have their habitation extending up to that of the beings whose individualities are immortal. For the individuality is a part of the type, as, for instance, man is a part of humanity; and each one follows the character of its type."},{"heading":"(10%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"Hence it comes that, while all types are imperishable, individuals are not all imperishable. Divinity forms a type of which all the individualisations are as immortal as itself. Among other beings eternity belongs only to the type; the individual perishes, and is perpetuated only by reproduction. There are, then, some mortal individualities. Thus man is mortal, humanity is immortal. Nevertheless, individuals of all the types mix with all the types."},{"heading":"(10%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"Some are primitive; others are produced by these, by God, by genii, by men, and all resemble their respective types. For bodies can be formed only by the divine will; individualities cannot be characterised without the aid of the genii; the education and training of animals cannot be conducted without man. All those genii who have forsaken their own type, and become joined in individuality to an individuality of the divine type, are regarded as neighbours and associates of the Gods."},{"heading":"(10%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"The genii who preserve the character of their type, and are properly called genii, love that which relates to mankind. The human type resembles, or even surpasses, theirs; for the individuality of the human is manifold and various, and results from the association mentioned above. It is the indispensable link between nearly all other individualities. The man who has affinity with the Gods through the intelligence which he shares with them, and through piety, is the neighbour of God."},{"heading":"(10%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"He who has affinity with the genii approximates himself to them. They who are satisfied with human mediocrity remain a part of the human type. Other human individualities will be neighbours of the types or individualities with which they shall be in affinity. PART III. Man, then, Asclepios, is a great marvel; a creature worthy of respect and adoration. For amid this divine Nature he moves as if he himself were a God."},{"heading":"(10%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"He knows the order of the genii, and, aware that he is of the same origin, he despises the human side of his being in order to attach himself exclusively to the divine element. How happily constituted and near to the Gods is humanity! In joining himself to the divine, man disdains that which he has in him of the earthly; he connects himself by a bond of love to all other beings, and thereby feels himself necessary to the universal order."},{"heading":"(10%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"He contemplates heaven; and in this happy middle sphere in which he is placed, he loves all that is below him, he is beloved of all that is above. He cultivates the earth; he borrows the speed of the elements; his piercing thought fathoms the deeps of the sea. Everything is clear for him. Heaven does not seem to him too high, for knowledge lifts him to it."},{"heading":"(10%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"The brightness of his mind is not obscured by the thick mists of the air; the earth’s gravitation is no obstacle to his efforts; the profundity of deep seas does not disturb him; he includes everything and remains everywhere the same. All animate beings have as it were roots passing downwards; inanimate beings, on the contrary, have a single root passing from below upwards, and supporting a whole forest of branches. Some creatures nourish themselves upon two elements, others upon one only."},{"heading":"(10%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"There are two kinds of aliment for the two portions of the creature one for the soul and another for the body. The soul of the world sustains itself by perpetual motion. Bodies develop themselves by means of water and of earth, the aliments of the inferior world. The spirit which fills everything, mingles with everything, and vivifies everything, adds consciousness to the intelligence, which, by a peculiar privilege, man borrows from the fifth element the ether."},{"heading":"(10%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"In man, the consciousness is raised to the knowledge of the divine order. Since I am led to speak of the consciousness, I will presently expound to you its function, which is great and holy as that of divinity itself. But let us first complete the exposition already begun. I was speaking of union with the Gods a privilege which they accord only to humanity. A few men only have the happiness of rising to that perception of the Divine which subsists only in God and in the human intelligence."},{"heading":"(20%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"Asclepios:  Are, then, not all men similarly conscient, Trismegistos? Hermes:  All, Asclepios, have not the true intelligence. They are deceived when they suffer themselves to be drawn after the image of things, without seeking for the true reason of them. It is thus that evil is produced in man; and that the first of all creatures lowers himself almost to the level of the brutes. But I will speak to you of the consciousness and all that belongs to it, when I come to my exposition of the mind."},{"heading":"(20%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"For man alone is a dual creature. One of the two parts of which he consists is single, and, as the Greeks say, essential; that is, formed after the divine likeness. The part which the Greeks call Kosmic that is, belonging to the world is quadruple, and constitutes the body, which, in man, serves as an envelope to the divine principle. This divine principle, and that which belongs to it, the perceptions of the pure intelligence, conceal themselves behind the rampart of the body. PART IV."},{"heading":"(20%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"Asclepios:  Why then, O Trismegistos, was it necessary that man should be placed in the world, instead of where God is, to dwell with Him in supreme beatitude? Hermes:  Thy question is natural, O Asclepios, and I pray God to assist me in replying to it, for everything depends upon His will, especially those great things which are at this moment the subject of our enquiry; listen, then, to me, Asclepios."},{"heading":"(20%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"The Lord and Author of all things, whom we call God, brought forth a second God, visible and sensible; I describe him thus, not because he himself has sensibility, for this is not the place to treat such a question, but because he is perceptible to the senses. Having then produced this unique Being who holds the first rank among creatures and the second after Himself, He found His offspring beautiful and filled with all manner of good, and He loved it as His own child."},{"heading":"(20%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"1 He willed, then, that another should be able to contemplate this Being so great and so perfect whom He had drawn forth from Himself, and to this end He created man, endowed with reason and intelligence. The will of God is absolute accomplishment; to will and to do are for Him the work of the selfsame instant. And, knowing that the essential could not apprehend all things unless enveloped by the world, He gave to man a body for a dwelling-place."},{"heading":"(20%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"He willed that man should have two natures; He united them intimately and blended them in just proportion. Thus, He formed man of spirit and of body; of an eternal nature and of a mortal nature, so that, a creature thus constituted, he might, by means of his double origin, admire and adore that which is celestial and eternal; cultivate and govern that which is upon the earth."},{"heading":"(20%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"I speak here of mortal things, not of the two elements subjected to man, to wit, earth and water, but of things coming from man, which are in him or depending on him, such as the culture of the soil, the pastures, the construction of buildings, of ports, navigation, commerce, and those reciprocal exchanges which are the strongest bond among men."},{"heading":"(20%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"Earth and water form a part of the world, and this terrestrial part is sustained by the arts and sciences, without which the world would be imperfect in the eyes of God. For that which God wills is necessary, and the effect accompanies His will; nor can it be believed that anything which has seemed good to Him can cease to seem good to Him, because from the beginning He knew what should be and what should please Him."},{"heading":"(20%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"PART V. But perceive, O Asclepios, that thou art anxious to know in what manner Heaven and those who inhabit it can be the object of the aspiration and adoration of man; learn, then, O Asclepios, that to aspire after the God of heaven and all those who are therein is to render them frequent homage; for alone of all animated beings, divine and human, man is able to render it."},{"heading":"(20%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"The admiration, adoration, praise, and homage of man rejoice heaven and the celestial inhabitants; and the choir of the Muses has been sent among men by the supreme Divinity in order that the terrestrial world might not be without the sweet science of hymns; or rather that the human voice might celebrate Him who only is All, since He is the Father of all things, and that the tender harmonies of earth might ever unite themselves with the celestial choirs."},{"heading":"(20%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"Only a few men, rarely endowed with a pure intelligence, are entrusted with this holy function of beholding heaven clearly. Those in whom the confusion of their two natures holds the intelligence captive under the weight of the body, are appointed to have communion with the inferior elements."},{"heading":"(20%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"Man is not, then, debased because he has a mortal part; on the contrary, this mortality augments his aptitudes and his power; his double functions are possible to him only by his double nature; he is constituted in such a manner that he can embrace alike the terrestrial and the divine. I desire, O Asclepios, that thou mayest bring to this exposition all the attention and all the ardour of thy mind; for many are wanting in faith concerning these things."},{"heading":"(20%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"And now I am about to unfold true principles for the instruction of the holiest intelligences. PART VI. The Master of Eternity is the first God, the world is the second, man is the third. God, Creator of the world and of all that it contains, governs all this universe and subjects it to the rule of man. And man makes of it the object of his special activity. So that the world and man become the appendage one of the other, and it is with reason that in Greek the world is called Kosmos."},{"heading":"(20%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"Man knows himself and knows the world; he should, therefore, distinguish that which is in accord with himself, that which is for his use and that which has a right to his worship. While addressing to God his praises and his acts of grace, he should venerate the world which is the image of God; remembering that he is himself the second image of God. For God has two similitudes: the world and man."},{"heading":"(20%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"The nature of man being complex, that part of him which is composed of soul, of consciousness, of mind, and of reason is divine, and from the superior elements seems able to mount to heaven; while his cosmic and mundane part, formed of fire, water, earth, and air, is mortal and remains upon the earth; so that what is borrowed from the world may be restored to it. It is thus that mankind is composed of a divine part and of a mortal part, to wit, the body."},{"heading":"(20%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"The law of this dual being, man, is religion, whose effect is goodness. Perfection is attained when the virtue of man preserves him from desire, and causes him to despise all that is foreign to himself. For terrestrial things, of which the body desires the possession, are foreign to all parts of the divine Thought. Such things may indeed be called possessions, for they are not born with us, they are acquired later."},{"heading":"(20%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"They are then foreign to man, and even the body itself is foreign to man, in such wise that man ought to disdain both the object of desire, and that whereby he is made accessible to desire. It is the duty of man to direct his soul by reason, so that- the contemplation of the divine may lead him to take but small account of that mortal part which has been joined to him for the sake of the preservation of the lower world."},{"heading":"(20%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"In order that man should be complete in both his parts, observe that each of these possesses four binary subdivisions to wit, the two hands and the two feet, which, with the other organs of the body, place him in relation with the inferior and terrestrial world. And, on the other hand, he possesses four faculties: sensibility, soul, memory, and foresight, which permit him to know and perceive divine things."},{"heading":"(30%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"He is able, therefore, to include in his investigations, differences, qualities, effects, and quantities. But if he be too much hindered by the weight of the body, he will be unable to penetrate into the true reason of things. When man, thus formed and constituted, having received for his function from the supreme God, the government of the world and the worship of Divinity, acquits himself well of this double duty, and obeys the holy Will, what should be his recompense?"},{"heading":"(30%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"For, if the world is the work of God, he who by his care sustains and augments its beauty, is the auxiliary of the divine Will, employing his body and his daily labour in the service of the work produced by the hands of God. What should be his recompense, if not that which our ancestors have obtained?"},{"heading":"(30%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"May it please divine goodness to accord this recompense also to us; all our aspirations and all our prayers tend towards its attainment; may we, delivered from the prison of the body, and from our mortal bonds, return, sanctified and pure, to the divine heritage of our nature! Asclepios:  What thou sayest is just and true, O Trismegistos! Such indeed is the price of piety towards God, and of care bestowed on the maintenance of the world."},{"heading":"(30%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"But return to the heavens is denied to those who have lived impiously; upon them is imposed a penance which holy souls escape, to wit, migration into other bodies. The end of this discourse, O Trismegistos, brings us to the hope of an eternal future for the soul, as the result of her life in the world. But this future is for some difficult to believe; for others it is a fable; for others, again, perhaps a subject of derision."},{"heading":"(30%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"For it is a sweet thing to enjoy what one possesses in the corporeal life. Therein lies the evil, which, as one may say, turns the soul’s head, attaches her to her mortal part, hinders her from knowing her divine part, and is envious of immortality. For I say unto thee, by a prophetic inspiration, no man after us will choose the simple way of philosophy, which lies wholly in application to the study of divine things, and in holy religion."},{"heading":"(30%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"The majority of men obscure philosophy with diverse questions. How come they to encumber it with sciences which ought not to be comprehended in it, or after what manner do they mingle in it diverse questions? Hermes:  O Asclepios, they mingle in it, by means of subtleties, a diversity of sciences which belong not to it arithmetic, music, geometry."},{"heading":"(30%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"But pure, philosophy, whose proper object is holy religion, ought to occupy itself with other sciences only in so far as to admire the regular phases of the stars, their positions and their courses, determined by calculation; the dimensions of the earth, its qualities and quantities; the depth of the sea; the power of fire; and to know the effects of all these things, and Nature; to adore Art, the artist, and his divine intelligence."},{"heading":"(30%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"As for music, that is apprehended when one apprehends reason and the divine order of things. For this order by which everything is ranged singly in the unity of the whole, is indeed an admirable harmony and a divine melody. Asclepios:  What then, after us, will men become? Hermes:  Misled by the subtleties of the sophists, they will turn aside from the true, pure and holy philosophy."},{"heading":"(30%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"To adore God in the simplicity of thought and of the soul, to venerate His works, to bless His will, which alone is the fulness of good this is the only philosophy which is not profaned by the idle curiosity of the mind. But enough on this matter. PART VII. Let us begin to speak of Mind and of other similar things. In the beginning were God and Hylè it is thus that the Greeks term the first matter or substance of the universe. The Spirit was with the universe, but not in the same manner as with God."},{"heading":"(30%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"The things which constitute the universe are not God, therefore before their birth they were not in existence, but they were already contained in that from which they were produced. For besides and without created things is not only that which is not yet born, but that also which has no generative fecundity, and which can bring forth nothing."},{"heading":"(30%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"Everything which has the power of generating contains in germ all that can be born of it, for it is easy to that which is brought forth to bear that which shall bring forth. But the eternal God cannot and never could be born; He is, He has been, He will be always. The nature of God is to be His own Principle. But matter, or the nature of the world, and mind, although appearing to be brought forth from the beginning, possess the power of birth and of procreation fecundative energy."},{"heading":"(30%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"For the beginning is in the quality of Nature, who possesses in herself the potentiality of conception and of production. She is then, without any foreign intervention, the principle of creation. It is otherwise with that which possesses only the power of conception by means of mixing with a second nature. The matrix of the universe and of all that it contains appears not to have been itself born, holding however, within it, potentially, all Nature."},{"heading":"(30%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"I call that the matrix which contains all things, for they could not have been without a vehicle to contain them. Everything which exists must exist in some place (or vehicle), neither qualities nor quantities, nor positions, nor effects could be distinguished in things having no place and being nowhere. Thus the world, although not having been born, has in it the principle of all birth; since it affords all things a fitting matrix for conception."},{"heading":"(30%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"It is, then, the sum-total of qualities and of matter susceptible of creation, although not yet created. Matter, being fecund in all attributes, is able also to engender evil. I put aside, therefore, O Asclepios and Ammon, the question asked by many: “Could not God hinder evil in the nature of things?” There is absolutely nothing to say to them; but for you I will pursue the discourse begun, and I will give the explanation."},{"heading":"(30%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"They affirm that God ought to have preserved the world from evil; now, evil is in the world as an integral part of it. The sovereign God indeed provided against it inasmuch as was reasonable and possible, when He bestowed upon humanity sentiment, knowledge, and intelligence. By these faculties solely, which place us above other animals, we may escape the snares of evil and vice."},{"heading":"(30%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"The man who is wise and protected by divine intelligence, knows how to preserve himself from such immediately he beholds them, and before he has been entrapped thereby. The foundation of knowledge is supreme goodness. Spirit governs and gives life to all that is in the world; it is an instrument employed by the will of the sovereign God. Thus we ought to comprehend, by intelligence alone, the supreme Intelligible called God."},{"heading":"(30%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"By Him is directed that secondary sensible God (the universe), who contains all spaces, all substances, the matter of all that engenders and produces, in a word, all that is. As for the spirit (or Mind), it moves and governs all individual beings in the world according to the nature which God has assigned to them."},{"heading":"(30%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"Matter Hylè, or the Kosmos is the receptacle, the motion, the replication of everything which God directs, dispensing to each of them that which is necessary to it, and filling them with spirit according to their qualities. The form of the universe is that of a hollow sphere, having in itself the cause of its quality or of its figure, wholly invisible; if, choosing any given point of its surface, one should seek to behold its depths, one would be unable to see anything."},{"heading":"(30%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"It appears visible only by means of those special forms whose images appear graven upon it, it shows itself only in effigy; but in reality it is always invisible in itself. Therefore, the centre, the depths of this sphere if indeed one may call it a place is in Greek named Hades, the invisible, from eidein, to see, because the centre of a sphere, cannot be seen from without. Moreover, the types or formative appearances were called Ideas, because they are the forms of the Invisible."},{"heading":"(40%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"This interior of the sphere which the Greeks call Hades, because it is invisible, the Latins name Hell (Inferno), on account of its profound position. These are the primordial principles, the first sources, of all things. Everything is in them, or by them, or comes forth from them. Asclepios:  These principles are, then, O Trismegistos, the universal substance of all individual appearances? Hermes:  The world nourishes bodies, the spirit nourishes souls."},{"heading":"(40%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"Thought, the heavenly gift which is the happy privilege of humanity, nourishes intelligence, but few men only have an intelligence capable of receiving such a benefit. Thought is a light which illuminates the intelligence, as the sun illuminates the world."},{"heading":"(40%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"And even more, for the light of the sun may be intercepted by the moon, or by the earth when night comes; but when thought has once penetrated into the human soul, it mingles intimately with her nature, and the intelligence can never again be obscured by any cloud. Therefore, with reason, it has been said that the souls of the Gods are intelligences. As for me, I say not this of all of them, but of the great supernal Gods. PART VIII."},{"heading":"(40%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"Asclepios:  What, O Trismegistos, are the primordial principles of things? Hermes:  I reveal to thee great and divine mysteries, and in beginning this initiation I implore the favour of heaven. There are many orders of the Gods; and in all there is an intelligible part.

The supreme Being of heaven, or of all that is comprehended under this name, is Zeus, for it is by heaven that Zeus gives life to all things."},{"heading":"(40%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"The supreme Being of the sun is light, for it is by the disk of the sun that we receive the benefit of the light. The thirty-six horoscopes of the fixed stars have for supreme Being or prince, him whose name is Pantomorphos, or having all forms, because he gives divine forms to divers types. The seven planets, or wandering spheres, have for supreme Spirits Fortune and Destiny, who uphold the eternal stability of the laws of Nature throughout incessant transformation and perpetual agitation."},{"heading":"(40%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"The ether is the instrument or medium by which all is produced. Thus, from the centre to the uttermost parts, everything moves, and relations are established according to natural analogies. That which is mortal approximates to that which is mortal, that which is sensible to that which is sensible. The supreme direction belongs to the supreme Master, in such wise that diversity is resolved into unity."},{"heading":"(40%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"For all things depend from unity or develope from it, and because they appear distant from one another it is believed that they are many, whereas, in their collectivity they form but one, or rather two, Principles. These two Principles, whence all things proceed, and by which all exist, are the substance of which things are formed, and the Will of Him who differentiates them. Asclepios:  What is the reason of this, O Trismegistos? Hermes:  It is this, Asclepios."},{"heading":"(40%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"God is the Father, the universal Ruler or whatever other name yet more holy and religious may be given to Him and which, because of our intelligence, ought to be held sacred between us; but, in considering His divinity, we cannot define Him by any such name.

This, O Asclepios, is why and how all things are of two sexes. Asclepios:  Sayest thou this also of God, O Trismegistos? Hermes:  Not only of God, but of all beings, whether animated or inanimate. For it is impossible that anything which exists should be barren."},{"heading":"(40%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"Were we to suppress the fecundity of existing things, it would be impossible for them to remain what they are. For I say that this law of generation is contained in Nature, in intellect, in the universe, and preserves all that is brought forth.

PART IX."},{"heading":"(50%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"And since we are brought to speak of the relationship and of the resemblance between men and Gods, behold, O Asclepios, the power and capacity of man! Even as the Ruler and Father, or to give Him the loftiest name God is the creator of the firmamental Gods, so is man the creator of the Gods who dwell in temples, pleased with human proximity, and not only themselves illumined, but illuminating.

PART XI."},{"heading":"(70%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"Since such is the state of the universe, there is nothing immutable, nothing stable, nothing unchanging in nature, either in the heavens or on the earth.

Hence, the created universe constitutes the imitation of this eternal universe."},{"heading":"(70%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"Time, despite its perpetual movement, possesses, by means of its necessary revolutions on itself, the force and nature of stability.

Thus both appear equally infinite and eternal. Stability being the fixed point which serves as the basis of Movement, must, because of this stability, hold the principal place. God and Eternity are, therefore, the principle of all things; but the world, which is mutable, cannot be considered the principle."},{"heading":"(80%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"The mutability of the world takes precedence of its stability, by means of the law of eternal movement in equilibrium. The whole consciousness of Divinity is then immutable, and moves only in equilibrium; it is holy, incorruptible, eternal; or to define it better, it is eternity, consisting in the very truth of the Supreme God, the plenitude of all feeling and knowledge, or indeed, so to speak, in God Himself."},{"heading":"(80%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"The consciousness of the natural universe includes all sensible things and species; the consciousness of humanity involves memory, by which man remembers his acts performed.

And even if this or that space, small or great, be empty of these elements, nothing can be empty of the spirit and aerial fluid. The same thing may be said of place; this word alone cannot be understood, unless it is applied to something."},{"heading":"(80%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"By omitting the chief term, the sense intended is lost; thus, it is correct to say, “the place of water,” “the place of fire,” or of any other similar thing.

If a place is supposed without its contents, then it is an empty place, and, in my judgment, such a place does not exist in the universe."},{"heading":"(80%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"But if nothing be void, then there can be no such thing as place in itself, unless it be qualified by length, breadth, and depth, even as human bodies have distinguishing signs."},{"heading":"(80%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"If, then, these things be so, O Asclepios and you who are also present, know that the Intelligible World, that is to say, God, Who is perceived only by the eye of intelligence, is incorporeal, and that nothing corporeal can be mingled with His nature, nor anything that can be defined by quality, quantity, or numeration, for there is nothing of such a kind in Him."},{"heading":"(80%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"This world, which is called the sensible world, is the receptacle of all sensible appearances, qualities, and bodies, nor can this universe exist without God.

Or dost thou speak of heaven, of the earth, and of the elements, for other beings continually change in appearance? But even so the heaven, now rainy, now dry, now hot, now cold, now clear, now covered with clouds, has many successive changes of aspect beneath its apparent uniformity."},{"heading":"(90%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"So also the earth constantly changes its aspect, for now it brings forth its fruits, now it hides them in its bosom, bearing products of diverse quality and quantity; here is repose, there is movement, and every variety of trees, flowers, seeds, properties, odours, savours, forms. Fire, likewise, has its manifold and divine transformations, for the sun and the moon have all manner of aspects comparable to the multitude of images beheld in mirrors."},{"heading":"(90%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"And now we have discoursed enough of these things. PART XIII. Let us return to man, and enquire concerning the divine gift of reason which entitles him to be called a reasonable creature. Among all the wonders we have noted in man, that which above all commands admiration is this: that man has discovered the divinity of nature, and has made it efficient to his designs."},{"heading":"(90%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"Our ancestors, wandering astray in matters of faith concerning the Gods, and unable to lift their minds to the Divine knowledge and religion, discovered the art of making Gods; and, having discovered it, they invested their products with appropriate virtues drawn from the nature of the world. And, as they could not make souls, they evoked the spirits of genii and angels, and endowed with them the holy images and sacraments, thus enabling their idols to exercise powers for good or ill."},{"heading":"(90%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"In such wise thine ancestor, O Asclepios, the inventor of medicine, has a temple on the Lybian mountain by the shores of the crocodile-frequented river, where also lies enshrined all of him which belonged to the earth that is, his body. For the rest of him his better part, or rather, indeed, himself because the principle of consciousness and of life is the whole man is restored to heaven."},{"heading":"(90%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"And now, by his divinity, he lends help to men in their sicknesses, who once instructed them in the art of healing. So also, Hermes, my own ancestor, whose name I bear, now enshrined in the country which is called after him, hears the prayers of those who come thither from all parts of the land to obtain of him assistance and health. Behold, again, what blessings Isis, the spouse of Osiris, confers upon men when she is favourable to them, and what ills she inflicts when she is angered!"},{"heading":"(90%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"For these mundane and earthly Gods are accessible to wrath, being formed and composed by men out of Nature. Of, such sort in Egypt is the adoration paid to animals; and thus also do cities honour the souls of those men who, in their lifetime, gave them laws and whose names they preserve. And for this reason, O Asclepios, those deities which are adored in some places, receive in others no worship; whence arise many wars between the cities of Egypt."},{"heading":"(90%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"Asclepios:  And of what kind, O Trismegistos, is the divinity of these Gods who inhabit the earth? Hermes:  It consists in the divine virtue, which naturally subsists in herbs, rocks, and aromatic principles, wherefore these deities love frequent sacrifices, hymns, and praises, and sweet music resembling the celestial harmony, which heaven-like rite, attractive to their sacred nature, draws them and retains them in their shrines, so that they patiently endure their long sojourn among men."},{"heading":"(90%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"It is thus that men make Gods. Neither must thou suppose, O Asclepios, that the acts of these terrestrial deities are controlled by hazard. For while the supernal Gods abide in the heights of heaven, keeping each the order which belongs to him, these Gods of ours have also their special functions."},{"heading":"(90%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"Some predict by means of lots and divination the events of the future; others preside, in various ways, over things depending on their care, or come to our assistance as allies, as kinsmen, or as friends.

If the heavenly Gods rule the universe, and the mundane deities control special events, where is the part of Destiny?"},{"heading":"(90%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"Hermes:  O Asclepios, Destiny is the necessity which compels all things that happen, the chain which binds together all events. It is thus the cause of things, the supreme deity, or rather the second God created by God, that is the law of all things in heaven and earth established upon divine ordinances. Destiny and Necessity are bound together indissolubly: Destiny produces the beginning of all things, Necessity enforces the effect which ensues from these beginnings."},{"heading":"(90%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"And hence arises Order that is, the sequence and disposition of things accomplished in Time; for nothing is performed without Order. And thus the world is perfected; for the world is founded on Order, and in Order the universe consists. Therefore these three, Destiny (which is Fate), Necessity, and Order, depend absolutely on the will of God Who governs the world by His divine law and reason."},{"heading":"(100%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"These three principles have no will in themselves; inflexible and inaccessible to favour as to anger, they are but the instruments of the eternal Reason, which is immutable, invariable, unalterable, indissoluble. First comes Destiny, containing, like newly-sown soil, the germs of future events. Necessity follows, urging them to their consummation. Lastly, Order maintains the fabric of things established by Destiny and Necessity."},{"heading":"(100%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"For all this is an ever-lasting sequence without beginning or end, sustained by its immutable law in the continuity of eternity. It rises and falls alternately, and as time rolls onward, that which had disappeared, again rises uppermost. For such is the condition of the circular movement; all things are interchained in such wise that neither beginning nor end can be distinguished, and they appear to precede and follow each other unceasingly."},{"heading":"(100%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"But as for accident and chance, they pervade all mundane affairs. PART XV. And now, inasmuch as it is given to man, and inasmuch as God has permitted, we have spoken concerning everything; it re-mains only, therefore, that we should bless and pray to God and return to our mortal cares, having satisfied our minds by treating of sacred things which are the food of the mind."},{"heading":"(100%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"Therewith, coming forth from the Sanctuary, they addressed to God their oraisons, turning themselves to the south, because when the sun begins to decline, he who would praise the God should direct his gaze thither, as in like manner, at sunrise, he should look towards the orient. And even while they pronounced their invocations, Asclepios, in a low voice, spoke thus: O Tatius, let us ask our father that our prayers may be accompanied with odours of incense and perfumes."},{"heading":"(100%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"Trismegistos heard, and was moved. May the omen be favourable, O Asclepios, he said. It is almost a sacrilege to burn incense or any other perfume during prayer; He Who is all and Who contains all, desires nothing. Let us give Him praise and adoration only; the divinest odours are acts of grace which mortals render to God."},{"heading":"(100%)","title":"A Treatise on Initiations, or Asclepios","content":"We give Thee thanks, O Lord Most High, for by Thy grace we have received the light of Thy knowledge; may Thy Name be adored and venerated, only Name by which Deity is praised according to the religion of our fathers!

Saved by Thy divine power, let us be glad in beholding the manifestation of Thyself; let us be glad that, from the hour of our sojourn in the body, Thou dost deign to consecrate us to eternity. The only joy of Man is the knowledge of Thy majesty.

O father, if nothing here below be real, how can one wisely employ one’s life? Trismegistos."},{"heading":"(10%)","title":"Fragments of the Book of Hermes to his Son Tatios","content":"Be religious, my son; religion is lofty philosophy; without philosophy there is no lofty religion. He who instructs himself concerning the universe, its law, its principle, and its end, gives thanks for all things to the Creator as to a gracious father, a good protector, a faithful teacher. This is religion, and by means of it we know where truth is and what it is. Knowledge increases religion."},{"heading":"(10%)","title":"Fragments of the Book of Hermes to his Son Tatios","content":"For when once the soul, imprisoned within the body, has lifted herself to the perception of the real Good and of Truth, she cannot again fall back. The might of Love, and the oblivion of all evil things, forbid the soul who knows her Maker to separate herself from the Good.

This way is beautiful and even; nevertheless, it is difficult for the soul to walk therein so long as she is immured within the prison of the body. For, first, she must contend against herself, and having accomplished a division of herself, she must submit to that part of herself which is first in dignity."},{"heading":"(10%)","title":"Fragments of the Book of Hermes to his Son Tatios","content":"For the one struggles against the two, that would fain rise, but these would drag it downwards. 1 Nor is victory the same to both sides; for the one tends towards the Good, and the two towards Evil; the one would be free, the two cling to servitude.

It is this one, my son, which ought to be thy guide."},{"heading":"(10%)","title":"Fragments of the Book of Hermes to his Son Tatios","content":"See that thou anoint thyself with oil for the struggle, maintain the fight for life, and remain victorious. And now, my son, I am about to sum up our principles; thou wilt understand my words by remembering that which thou hast learnt. All beings are endowed with motion; non-being alone is motionless. All bodies transform themselves some only decompose. All creatures are not mortal nor are all immortal."},{"heading":"(10%)","title":"Fragments of the Book of Hermes to his Son Tatios","content":"That which is dissoluble is corruptible; that which is permanent is immutable; that which is immutable is eternal; that which is continually generated is continually corrupted, but that which is born but once is not corrupted and is not changed into any other thing.

The emotional part of the Soul is mortal; her rational part is immortal; all substance is immortal, all substance is subjected to change."},{"heading":"(10%)","title":"Fragments of the Book of Hermes to his Son Tatios","content":"All being is dual; no being is permanent. All things are not animated by soul, but all that is being is animated by soul. All that is passive is sentient; all that is sentient is transient.

In God is Intelligence; in Man is Reason. Reason is in Intelligence, Intelligence is intransient."},{"heading":"(10%)","title":"Fragments of the Book of Hermes to his Son Tatios","content":"There is nothing real in the corporeal; nothing false in the incorporeal. Everything that is born changes, but not everything born corrupts. There is nothing perfect upon earth, nor anything evil in heaven. God is perfect; man is evil. The good comes by will; evil against will. The Gods chose the good as good. Time is divine; law is human. Evil is the pabulum of the world; Time is the destruction of man. All things in heaven are immutable; nothing is immutable on earth."},{"heading":"(10%)","title":"Fragments of the Book of Hermes to his Son Tatios","content":"In heaven, then, is no servitude; on earth there is no freedom. Nothing in heaven is unknown; on earth nothing is known. There is nothing in common between celestial things and things terrestrial.

That which is sown does not always come up; but that which comes up has always been sown."},{"heading":"(10%)","title":"Fragments of the Book of Hermes to his Son Tatios","content":"Corruptible bodies have two periods of existence: from conception to birth, and from birth to death; but the eternal entity has one period only from the moment of being. Dissoluble bodies increase and diminish. Dissoluble matter divides itself according to two contrary terms destruction and birth; immortal substance divides itself either into itself or into its similars. The birth of man is a destruction; the destruction of man is an element of birth. That which ends begins; that which begins ends."},{"heading":"(20%)","title":"Fragments of the Book of Hermes to his Son Tatios","content":"Among beings, some are in bodies, some in forms, some in energies. The body is in forms; form and energy are in bodies. The immortal receives nothing from the mortal; but the mortal receives from the immortal.

That which is on earth profits not that which is in heaven; but all that is in heaven profits that which is on earth."},{"heading":"(20%)","title":"Fragments of the Book of Hermes to his Son Tatios","content":"Heaven contains immortal entities; earth contains perishable bodies. Earth is irrational; heaven is reasonable. Celestial things are under the power of heaven; terrestrial things are upon earth. Heaven is the primordial element.

Tatios."},{"heading":"(30%)","title":"Fragments of the Book of Hermes to his Son Tatios","content":"How then is it, father, that we behold certain animals making use of scientific and constructive knowledge; as, for instance, the ants who store up provisions for the winter, the birds who devise nests, the cattle who know their stables and return thither? Trismegistos. It is neither science nor art that directs them, my son, but nature. Science and art are acquired, but these creatures have acquired nothing."},{"heading":"(30%)","title":"Fragments of the Book of Hermes to his Son Tatios","content":"That which is naturally performed is the product of the universal activity; science and art belong only to those who have acquired them.

For which reason there will always be bodies; wherefore the creation of bodies is an eternal function."},{"heading":"(30%)","title":"Fragments of the Book of Hermes to his Son Tatios","content":"For terrestrial bodies are corruptible; nevertheless, bodies are necessary as abodes and as instruments for the energies.

The creation of bodies is, then, a function, and an eternal function."},{"heading":"(30%)","title":"Fragments of the Book of Hermes to his Son Tatios","content":"The energies or faculties of the soul are not all at once manifest; certain of them are manifest from the time of the birth of man, in the non-rational part of his soul; and as the reasonable part develops itself with age, the loftier faculties also lend their assistance. The faculties are attached to bodies. They descend from divine forms into mortal forms, and by them bodies are created."},{"heading":"(30%)","title":"Fragments of the Book of Hermes to his Son Tatios","content":"Each of the faculties exercises a function either of the body or of the soul, but they subsist in the soul independently of the body. For the energies are eternal, but the soul is not always imprisoned in a mortal body. She can live without it, yet the faculties cannot manifest themselves unless in a body. This, my son, is an arcane discourse. The body cannot remain without the soul, but being can. Tatios. What meanest thou, my father? Trismegistos. Understand me, O Tatios."},{"heading":"(30%)","title":"Fragments of the Book of Hermes to his Son Tatios","content":"When the soul is separated from the body, the body indeed remains, but it is undermined by interior dissolution, and ends by disintegrating. Such an effect cannot be produced without an active cause; therefore, there remains some energy in the body after the withdrawal of the soul. Between an immortal entity and a mortal entity there is this difference: that the first is formed of simple substance, but not so the second. One is active, the other passive."},{"heading":"(40%)","title":"Fragments of the Book of Hermes to his Son Tatios","content":"All active being dominates, all passive being obeys; one is free, and governs; the other is in servitude, and subject to impulsion. Now, the energies are not only in animate bodies, but in inanimate, such as wood, stone, and other like things. By means of the energies these things increase, fructify, ripen, decompose, dissolve, putrefy, disintegrate, and undergo all those changes of which inanimate bodies are susceptible. For energy is that which produces change, or becoming."},{"heading":"(40%)","title":"Fragments of the Book of Hermes to his Son Tatios","content":"And becoming is multiple, or rather universal. Never will anything capable of birth be wanting to the universe, because beings are continually brought forth by it and continually destroyed. All energy is then indestructible, no matter of what nature or in what body it is manifest. But among the energies, some are exerted in divine entities, some in mortal entities; some are universal, others special; some act upon species, others on individuals pertaining to these."},{"heading":"(40%)","title":"Fragments of the Book of Hermes to his Son Tatios","content":"Divine energies are exerted in eternal entities, and are perfect as these. Partial energies act by means of living beings; special energies in everything which exists. Whence it results, my son, that the whole universe is full of energies. For since energies necessarily manifest in bodies, there are many bodies in the universe."},{"heading":"(40%)","title":"Fragments of the Book of Hermes to his Son Tatios","content":"Nevertheless, the energies are more numerous than the bodies, for often there exist one, two, three energies in a body, without counting those which are universally distributed. I call those universal energies which are inseparable from bodies and which manifest themselves by sensations and movements, and without which no body could exist. Far otherwise are those special energies which manifest themselves in human minds by art, science, and labour."},{"heading":"(40%)","title":"Fragments of the Book of Hermes to his Son Tatios","content":"The sensations accompany the energies, or rather are the consequence of these last. Understand, O my son, the difference there is between the energies and the sensations. Energy comes from above; sensation is of the body, and from the body has its being. It is the seat of the energy, which manifests by means of it, and from which it obtains, as it were, a vehicle."},{"heading":"(50%)","title":"Fragments of the Book of Hermes to his Son Tatios","content":"For this reason I say that sensations are corporeal and mortal; their existence is bound up with that of the body, they are born therewith, and therewith they die. Immortal energies have not sensation, precisely because of the nature of their essence; for there can be no other sensation than that of some good or some evil which happens to a body or which departs therefrom, and immortal entities are not subject to these accidents. Tatios. Sensation, then, is experienced by all bodies? Trismegistos."},{"heading":"(50%)","title":"Fragments of the Book of Hermes to his Son Tatios","content":"Yes, my son, and in all bodies the energies act. Tatios. Even in inanimate bodies, my father? Trismegistos. Even in inanimate bodies. Sensations are of different kinds; those of reasonable beings are accompanied by reason; those of beings without reason are purely corporeal; those of inanimate beings are passive, and consist only in growth and decay. Starting from one principle and arriving at one end, passion and sensation are alike the product of the energies."},{"heading":"(50%)","title":"Fragments of the Book of Hermes to his Son Tatios","content":"In animate beings, there are two other energies which accompany the passions and the sensations to wit, joy and sorrow. Without these, the animated being, and, above all, the reasonable being, would feel nothing; they may then be considered as modes of the affections in reasonable beings, or indeed in all living beings. They are activities manifested by the sensations, corporeal movements produced by the irrational parts of the soul."},{"heading":"(50%)","title":"Fragments of the Book of Hermes to his Son Tatios","content":"Joy and sorrow are alike evil; for joy that is, the sensation accompanied by pleasure draws after it great evils; sorrow, likewise, involves penalties and suffering, yet more severe. Both joy and sorrow, then, are evil. Tatios. Is sensation the same thing in the soul and in the body, my father? Trismegistos. What meanest thou, my child, by the sensation of the soul? Tatios. The soul is truly incorporeal. But sensation is as a body, my father, for it exists in a body. Trismegistos."},{"heading":"(60%)","title":"Fragments of the Book of Hermes to his Son Tatios","content":"If we place it in the body, my son, we indeed assimilate it either to the soul or to the energies, which, although in the body, are incorporeal. But sensation is neither an energy nor a soul, nor anything distinct from the body; it is not, therefore, incorporeal. If it be not incorporeal, it must necessarily be corporeal, for there is nothing which is neither corporeal nor incorporeal. PART III."},{"heading":"(60%)","title":"Fragments of the Book of Hermes to his Son Tatios","content":"The Lord, the Creator of immortal forms, O Tatios, after having accomplished His work, made nothing further, nor does He now make anything. Once consigned to themselves and united to one another, these eternal forms move without having need of anything; or if, indeed, they are necessary one to another, they have at least no need of any extraneous impulsion, since they are immortal. Such ought, indeed, to be the nature of the creations of the supreme God."},{"heading":"(60%)","title":"Fragments of the Book of Hermes to his Son Tatios","content":"But our (immediate) maker has a body; he has brought us forth, and unceasingly he brings forth, and will bring forth dissoluble and mortal bodies, for he ought not to imitate his own Creator, and, moreover, he cannot. For the first has evolved His creations from His own essence, primordial and incorporeal; the second has formed us of that which is corporeal and engendered."},{"heading":"(60%)","title":"Fragments of the Book of Hermes to his Son Tatios","content":"Whence it follows naturally, that heavenly forms born of incorporeal essence are imperishable, while our bodies, being constituted of corporeal matter, are consequently weak in themselves, and need extraneous assistance. For how, indeed, could the combination which composes our bodies be sustained, if it were not continually fed and supported by elements of the same nature? The earth, the water, the fire, and the air flow into us and renew our covering."},{"heading":"(60%)","title":"Fragments of the Book of Hermes to his Son Tatios","content":"We are so weak that we cannot even endure a single day of movement. Thou knowest well, my son, that without the repose of the night our bodies would not resist the day’s toil. For this reason our good creator, in his universal providence, has ensured the continual life of his creatures by devising sleep, the restorer of movement, and by assigning to repose an equal or even longer time (than to labour). Meditate, my son, on this virtue of sleep, opposed to that of the soul, and not less energetic."},{"heading":"(60%)","title":"Fragments of the Book of Hermes to his Son Tatios","content":"For if the function of the soul be movement, bodies cannot live without slumber, which loosens and unbinds the yoke of the organism, and by its restoring action dispenses to it the matter which it needs, giving water to the blood, earth to the bones, air to the nerves and vessels, fire to the eyes. And hence the great pleasure which the body finds in sleep. PART IV. Great and divine power is established, O my son, in the midst of the universe, beholding all that is done by men upon earth."},{"heading":"(60%)","title":"Fragments of the Book of Hermes to his Son Tatios","content":"In the divine order all is governed by providential Necessity; among men the same function belongs to Justice. The first of these governments includes celestial things, for the Gods neither will, nor can, transgress; not being subject to error, which is the source of sin, they are sinless. The second, Justice, is charged to correct, upon earth, the evil which happens among men."},{"heading":"(70%)","title":"Fragments of the Book of Hermes to his Son Tatios","content":"The human race, being mortal, and formed of corruptible matter, is subject to fall away when the sight of divine things does not sustain it (in virtue). Herein Justice exerts its action. By means of the energies which he draws from Nature, man is subject to Destiny; by the errors of his life, to Justice. PART V. Here, then, is that which can be said of the three tenses. They are not by themselves, and they are not bound together; again, they are bound together and are by themselves."},{"heading":"(70%)","title":"Fragments of the Book of Hermes to his Son Tatios","content":"Can the present be supposed without the existence of the past? One cannot exist without another, for the present is generated by the past, and from the present the future comes forth. If we wish to go to the root of the matter, we must reason thus: The past tense is withdrawn into that which no longer is; the future is not so long as it has not become present; the present, in its turn, ceases to be itself the instant that it remains."},{"heading":"(70%)","title":"Fragments of the Book of Hermes to his Son Tatios","content":"Can that which does not endure for an instant and which has no fixed centre be called present when it cannot even be said to exist? Moreover, since the past is indistinguishable from the present, and the present from the future, they become one. There is among them identity, unity, continuity. Therefore time is continuous and divisible, even while it is one and identical. PART VI. O my son, matter becomes; formerly it was, for matter is the vehicle of becoming."},{"heading":"(70%)","title":"Fragments of the Book of Hermes to his Son Tatios","content":"1 Becoming is the mode of activity of the uncreate and foreseeing God. Having been endowed with the germ of becoming, matter is brought into birth, for the creative force fashions it according to the ideal forms. Matter not yet engendered, had no form; it becomes when it is put into operation. PART VII."},{"heading":"(70%)","title":"Fragments of the Book of Hermes to his Son Tatios","content":"To speak of the Real with certainty, O Tatios, is an impossible thing to man, himself an imperfect creature, composed of imperfect parts, and constituted of an assemblage of foreign particles; nevertheless, as much as it is possible and permissible to me, I affirm that Reality is only in eternal beings, the forms of which also are real. Fire is but fire and no more; earth is nothing else than earth; air is only air."},{"heading":"(70%)","title":"Fragments of the Book of Hermes to his Son Tatios","content":"Put our bodies are compounded of all these; we have in us fire, earth, water, and air, which yet are neither fire, nor earth, nor water, nor air, nor anything truly.

Trismegistos."},{"heading":"(80%)","title":"Fragments of the Book of Hermes to his Son Tatios","content":"Reality is not upon the earth, my son, and it cannot be thereon, but it can be comprehended by a few men to whom God vouchsafes the divine vision.

Tatios. What sayest thou? It is right to think and speak that which truly is, and yet nothing is true upon earth? Trismegistos."},{"heading":"(80%)","title":"Fragments of the Book of Hermes to his Son Tatios","content":"This certainly is true, that we know nothing of Truth. How should it be otherwise, my son? Truth is the supreme virtue, the sovereign Good which is not obscured by matter, nor circumscribed by the body; the naked Good, evident, unalterable, august, immutable.

That which is not even identical with itself, how can it be real?"},{"heading":"(80%)","title":"Fragments of the Book of Hermes to his Son Tatios","content":"All that transforms itself is illusive, not only in itself, but by the appearances which it presents to us one after another. Tatios. Is not even man real, my father? Trismegistos. He is not real, my son, as man. The real consists solely in itself, and remains what it is. Man is composed of manifold elements, and does not continue identical with himself. So long as he inhabits a body he passes from one age to another, and from one form to another."},{"heading":"(90%)","title":"Fragments of the Book of Hermes to his Son Tatios","content":"Often, after but a short interval of time, parents no longer are able to recognize their children, nor children their parents. That which changes in such wise as to be no longer recognizable as itself, can it be a real thing, Tatios? Should we not rather think this succession of diverse appearances an illusion?

Tatios."},{"heading":"(90%)","title":"Fragments of the Book of Hermes to his Son Tatios","content":"Then the celestial bodies themselves are not real, my father, since they also vary. Trismegistos. That which is subject to birth and to change is not real, but the works of the great Father may receive from Him a real substance.

Life constitutes the creature, intelligence renders it reasonable, the body makes it mortal."},{"heading":"(60%)","title":"Fragments of the Writings of Hermes","content":"The soul is then incorporeal, and possesses an immutable force. Can an intelligent creature exist without a living essence? Can he be rational if an intelligent essence does not maintain in him rational life?

This harmonic combination has three forms: the hot, the cold, and the temperate. Conjunction is established according to stellar influence.

PART V. The soul is then, O Ammon, an essence having its end in itself, receiving from the beginning the life prepared for her, and attracting to herself, as a material, a certain reason endowed with passion and desire. Passion is a matter; if it enters into accord with the intelligent part of the soul, it becomes courage, and does not yield to fear."},{"heading":"(70%)","title":"Fragments of the Writings of Hermes","content":"Desire also is a matter; in association with the rational part of the soul, it becomes aspiration and yields not to voluptuousness.

Every soul is immortal, and always in movement. For we have seen that movements proceed either from energies or from bodies. We have seen, also, that the soul, being incorporeal, proceeds not from any matter, but from an essence incorporeal itself. Everything that is born is necessarily produced by some other thing."},{"heading":"(80%)","title":"Fragments of the Writings of Hermes","content":"Two movements necessarily accompany everything the generation of which involves decay; that of the soul which moves it, and that of the body which augments, diminishes, and decomposes it, in decomposing itself. It is thus that I define the movement of perishable bodies. But the soul is perpetually in motion, without cessation she moves and produces movement. Thus every soul is immortal and always in motion, moved by her own activity. There are three species in souls: divine, human, and irrational."},{"heading":"(80%)","title":"Fragments of the Writings of Hermes","content":"The divine soul abides in a divine form, it is therein that she has her energy; therein she moves and acts.

All bodies are unintelligent, but in receiving the spirit they become animated and breathe."},{"heading":"(100%)","title":"Fragments of the Writings of Hermes","content":"The breath belongs to the body, but reason contemplates the beauty of the essential. The sensible spirit discerns appearances. It is distributed into organic sensations; mental perception is a part of it, as also is the acoustic, olfactive, gustative, and tactile sense.

That which receives the form of life participates in being by means of the soul. In order to produce existence, it is necessary to exist; existence I define to be a reasonable becoming and participation in intelligent life. Life constitutes the creature, intelligence renders it reasonable, the body makes it mortal."},{"heading":"(60%)","title":"Fragments of the Writings of Hermes to Ammon","content":"The soul is then incorporeal, and possesses an immutable force. Can an intelligent creature exist without a living essence? Can he be rational if an intelligent essence does not maintain in him rational life? If intelligence does not manifest itself in all creatures, it is on account of the constitution of the body in regard to harmony. If heat dominates in the constitution thereof, the creature is volatile and ardent; if cold dominates, it is heavy and slow."},{"heading":"(60%)","title":"Fragments of the Writings of Hermes to Ammon","content":"Nature distributes the elements of the body according to a law of harmony. This harmonic combination has three forms: the hot, the cold, and the temperate. Conjunction is established according to stellar influence. The soul appropriates the body destined to her, and causes it to live by the operation of nature. Nature assimilates the harmony of bodies to the disposition of the stars, and the combination of their elements to the harmony of the stars; so that there may be reciprocal sympathy."},{"heading":"(70%)","title":"Fragments of the Writings of Hermes to Ammon","content":"For the purpose of stellar harmony is to engender sympathies in agreement with Destiny. PART V. The soul is then, O Ammon, an essence having its end in itself, receiving from the beginning the life prepared for her, and attracting to herself, as a material, a certain reason endowed with passion and desire. Passion is a matter; if it enters into accord with the intelligent part of the soul, it becomes courage, and does not yield to fear."},{"heading":"(70%)","title":"Fragments of the Writings of Hermes to Ammon","content":"Desire also is a matter; in association with the rational part of the soul, it becomes aspiration and yields not to voluptuousness. For reason enlightens the blindness of desire. When the faculties of the soul are thus co-ordinated under the supremacy of reason, they produce justice. The government of the faculties of the soul belongs to the Intellectual Principle which subsists in itself in its provident reason, having for authority its own reason."},{"heading":"(70%)","title":"Fragments of the Writings of Hermes to Ammon","content":"It governs all like a magistrate; its provident reason serves it as counsellor. The reason of this Principle is the cognizance of the reasons which furnish the image of rationality to the irrational; an image relatively obscure when compared with reason, but rational when compared to the irrational, as an echo compared to a voice, or the light of the moon compared to that of the sun."},{"heading":"(70%)","title":"Fragments of the Writings of Hermes to Ammon","content":"Passion and desire are ordained according to a certain reason; they mutually attract each other, and establish between them a circulatory current of thought. Every soul is immortal, and always in movement. For we have seen that movements proceed either from energies or from bodies. We have seen, also, that the soul, being incorporeal, proceeds not from any matter, but from an essence incorporeal itself. Everything that is born is necessarily produced by some other thing."},{"heading":"(80%)","title":"Fragments of the Writings of Hermes to Ammon","content":"Two movements necessarily accompany everything the generation of which involves decay; that of the soul which moves it, and that of the body which augments, diminishes, and decomposes it, in decomposing itself. It is thus that I define the movement of perishable bodies. But the soul is perpetually in motion, without cessation she moves and produces movement. Thus every soul is immortal and always in motion, moved by her own activity. There are three species in souls: divine, human, and irrational."},{"heading":"(80%)","title":"Fragments of the Writings of Hermes to Ammon","content":"The divine soul abides in a divine form, it is therein that she has her energy; therein she moves and acts. When this soul separates herself from mortal creatures, she forsakes her irrational parts and enters into the divine form; and, as she is always in motion, she is borne along in the universal movement."},{"heading":"(80%)","title":"Fragments of the Writings of Hermes to Ammon","content":"The human soul has also something divine, but she is bound to irrational elements desire and passion; these elements are undying, because they are energies; but they are energies of mortal bodies, therefore they are removed from the divine part of the soul, which inhabits the divine form. When this divine part enters into a mortal body and meets therein these irrational elements, she becomes, by means of their presence, a human soul."},{"heading":"(90%)","title":"Fragments of the Writings of Hermes to Ammon","content":"The soul of animals is composed of passion and desire, therefore the animals are called brutes, because their soul is deprived of reason. The fourth species in soul, that possessed by inanimate creatures, is placed outside the bodies actuated. This soul moves in the divine form, and impels it passively. PART VI. The soul is, then, an eternal and intelligent essence; having for thought her own reason. She enters into association with the concept of harmony."},{"heading":"(90%)","title":"Fragments of the Writings of Hermes to Ammon","content":"Separated from the physical body, she endures in herself, she is independent in the Ideal world. She controls her reason, and confers on the entity emerging into life a movement analogous to her own thought, that is being; for the property of the soul is to assimilate other things to her own character. There are two kinds of vital movement: the one conform-able to the essence of the soul, the other to the nature of the body."},{"heading":"(100%)","title":"Fragments of the Writings of Hermes to Ammon","content":"The first is general, the second particular; the first is independent, the second is subject to necessity. For everything moved is subject to the necessary law of the mover. But the motor movement is united by affinity to the intelligent principle. It behoves the soul to be incorporeal, and to be essentially different from the physical body, for if she had a body she would have neither reason nor thought. All bodies are unintelligent, but in receiving the spirit they become animated and breathe."},{"heading":"(100%)","title":"Fragments of the Writings of Hermes to Ammon","content":"The breath belongs to the body, but reason contemplates the beauty of the essential. The sensible spirit discerns appearances. It is distributed into organic sensations; mental perception is a part of it, as also is the acoustic, olfactive, gustative, and tactile sense. This spirit, attracted by thought, discerns sensations, otherwise it creates only phantoms, for it belongs to the body, and receives all things. The reason of the essential is the judgment."},{"heading":"(100%)","title":"Fragments of the Writings of Hermes to Ammon","content":"To the reason belongs the cognizance of lofty things; but to the sensible spirit, opinion.

Thy terrestrial world in which all creatures are contained is bereft of God."},{"heading":"(40%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"And because they revere nothing, they transgress every law and overwhelm me with all manner of evil works. To my shame, O Lord, I admit into myself the product of the corruption of carcases. But I, who receive all things, would fain also receive God. Grant to earth this grace, and if Thou comest not Thyself for indeed I cannot contain Thee let me at least receive some holy efflux of Thee."},{"heading":"(50%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"Let the earth become the most glorious of all the elements; and since she alone gives all things to all, may she revere herself as the recipient of Thy favours.” Thus the elements discoursed, and forthwith God filled the universe with His divine voice. “Go,” said He, “sacred offspring, worthy of your Father’s greatness, seek not to change anything, nor refuse to my creatures your ministry."},{"heading":"(50%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"I will send you an efflux of myself, a pure Being who shall investigate all actions, who shall be the dreadful and incorruptible Judge of the living; and sovereign justice shall extend its reign even into the shades beneath the earth. Thus shall every man receive his merited deserts.” Thereupon the elements ceased from their complaints, and each of them resumed its functions and its sway. And in what manner, O my mother, said Horos, did the earth afterwards obtain this efflux of God?"},{"heading":"(50%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"I will not recount this Nativity, said Isis; I dare not, O powerful Horos, declare the origin of thy race, lest men in the future should learn the generation of the Gods. I will say only that the Supreme God, Creator and Architect of the world, at length accorded to earth for a season, thy father Osiris and the great Goddess Isis, that they might bring the expected salvation."},{"heading":"(50%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"By them life attained its fulness; savage and bloody wars were ended; they consecrated temples to the Gods their ancestors, and instituted oblations. They gave to mortals law, nourishment, and raiment. “They shall read,” Hermes said, “my mystic writings, and dividing them into two parts, they shall keep certain of them, and inscribe upon columns and obelisks those which may be useful to man.” Institutors of the first tribunals, they established everywhere the reign of order and justice."},{"heading":"(50%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"With them began the faith of treaties, and the introduction into human life of the religious duty of oaths. They taught the rites of sepulture towards those who cease to live; they interrogated the horrors of death; they shewed that the spirit from without delights to return into the human body, and that if the way of entry be shut against it, it brings about a failure of life. Instructed by Hermes, they engraved upon hidden tables that the air is filled with genii."},{"heading":"(50%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"Instructed by Hermes in the secret laws of God, they alone were the teachers and legislators of mankind, initiating them in the arts, the sciences, and the benefits of civilised life. Instructed by Hermes concerning the sympathetic affinities which the Creator has established between heaven and earth, they instituted religious representations and sacred mysteries."},{"heading":"(50%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"And, considering the corruptible nature of all bodies, they ordained prophetic initiation, so that the prophet who lifts his hands to the Gods should be instructed in all things, and that thereby philosophy and magic might provide nourishment for the soul, and medicine might heal the sufferings of the flesh."},{"heading":"(60%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"Having performed all these things, O my son, and seeing the world arrived at its fulness, Osiris and I were recalled by the inhabitants of heaven; but we could not return thither without having first praised the Lord, so that the celestial Vision might fill the expanse, and that the way of a happy ascension might open before us, since God delights in hymns. O my mother, said Horos, teach me this hymn, that I also may be instructed in it. Hearken, my son, answered Isis. PART II."},{"heading":"(60%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"O my illustrious son, if thou wilt know any-thing further, ask it of me. And Horos said, Revered Mother, I would fain know how royal souls are born. And Isis answered: Herein, my son Horos, lies the distinctive character of royal souls. There are in the universe, four regions, governed by a fixed and immutable law: heaven, the ether, the air, and the most holy earth."},{"heading":"(60%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"Above, in heaven, dwell the Gods, ruled as are all the rest, by the Maker of the universe; in the ether are the stars, governed by the great fire, the sun; in the air are the souls of the genii, governed by the moon; upon earth are men and other animals governed by the soul who, for the time, is their king. For the Gods themselves engender those who shall be kings befitting the terrestrial race. Princes are the issue of kings, and he who is most kingly, is a greater king than the rest."},{"heading":"(60%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"1 The sun, nearer to God than is the moon, is greater and stronger than she, and to him she is subject as much by rank as by power. The king is the last of the Gods and the first of men. So long as he sojourns upon earth, his divinity is concealed, but he possesses something which distinguishes him from other men and approximates him to God. The soul in him comes from a loftier region than that from which descend the souls of common men."},{"heading":"(60%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"Souls destined to reign upon the earth descend thither for two causes. There are those who in former lives have lived blameless, and who merit apotheosis; for such as these royalty is a preparation for the divine state. Again, there are holy souls who, for some slight infringement of the interior and divine law, receive in royalty a penance whereby the suffering and shame of incarnation are mitigated."},{"heading":"(60%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"The condition of these in taking a body resembles not that of others; they are as blessed as when they were free. As to the various characters of these kings, the variety is not in the souls, for all are royal, but it is due to the nature of the angels and genii who assist them. For souls destined to such offices are not without ministers and escort. Heavenly justice, even while exiling them from the abodes of the Blessed, treats them as their nature befits."},{"heading":"(60%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"When, then, O my son Horos, the ministering angels and genii appointed are warlike, the soul in their charge takes that character, forgetting its own, or rather laying it aside until some future change of condition. If the guardian angels are of a gentle order, then the soul follows its path in peace; if they are friends of judgment, the soul loves to judge; if they are musicians, then the soul sings; if they love truth, the soul is that of a philosopher."},{"heading":"(60%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"Thus the souls necessarily follow the teaching of their guardians; falling into human bodies they forego their proper estate, and while exiled from it they approximate to those intelligences by whom they have been embodied. Thine explanation is complete, my mother, said Horos, but thou hast not yet informed me in what manner noble souls are born. There are upon earth, O my son, different offices."},{"heading":"(60%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"So also is it among souls; they occupy different stations, and that soul which issues from a more exalted sphere is nobler than the rest; even as he who is free among men, is nobler than the slave. Exalted and royal souls are necessarily the masters of men. How are souls born male or female? Souls, my son Horos, are all equal in nature, since they come from one region wherein the Creator has formed them."},{"heading":"(60%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"There are not among them either males or females; this distinction exists only between bodies, and not between incorporeal beings. But some are more energetic, some are gentler; and this belongs to the air in which all things are formed. For an airy body envelopes the soul; in it are the elements of earth, water, air, and fire. Among females this combination contains more of cold and of moisture than of dryness and heat, and the soul which is enfolded therein is watery and disposed to softness."},{"heading":"(60%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"The contrary happens among males; their envelope contains more of dryness and of heat, less of cold and of moisture; hence in bodies so formed the souls manifest greater vivacity and energy. And how, O my mother, are born the souls of the wise? And Isis answered: The organ of vision is enveloped in tunics. When these tunics are thick and dense, the sight is dull; when they are fine and subtle, the sight is penetrating."},{"heading":"(60%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"Even so is it with the soul; she likewise has her coverings, incorporeal as herself. These coverings are the interior airs; when they are subtle, clear, and transparent, then the soul is perspicuous; when, on the contrary, they are dense, thick, and turgid, then she cannot see far; and discerns only, as though in cloudy weather, that which lies immediately before her steps."},{"heading":"(60%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"And Horos said: For what reason, my mother, are the minds of men who are not of our holy country less open than the minds of those who belong to it? And Isis replied 1: The earth is set in the midst of the universe like a man lying on his back and gazing into heaven, and the various regions of earth correspond to the different members of the man. The earth turns her gaze towards heaven as towards her father, following in her changes the changes of the skies."},{"heading":"(60%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"Her head lies to the south, her right shoulder to the east, her left is turned towards the Lybian wind, her feet are under the constellation of the Bear, the right beneath the tail, and the left beneath the head of the Bear; her loins are under the regions of heaven nearest to the Bear; the midst of her body is beneath the centre of heaven."},{"heading":"(60%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"Behold as a proof of these things, how they who dwell in the South have a beautiful countenance and plentiful hair, while the orientals have hands hardy in conflict and ready with the bow, for they are right-handed; the westerns are strong and fight with the left hand, attributing to the left side the functions which belong in others to the right; those who dwell beneath the Bear are distinguished by the attributes of their feet, and by the beauty of their legs; those who inhabit beyond the Bear in the climate of Italy and of Greece are remarkable for the beauty of their loins, and hence their tendency to prefer males."},{"heading":"(60%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"This part of the body also, being whiter than the rest, produces men of a whiter hue. The hallowed region of our ancestors is in the midst of the earth, and since the midst of the human body is the seat of the heart, and the heart of the soul, this is why, my son, the men of this land, beside the qualities which all men possess in common, have also a loftier intelligence and wisdom, because the heart of the earth brings them forth and nourishes them."},{"heading":"(60%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"Moreover, my son, the south is the storehouse of the clouds; it is there they assemble, and thence, it is said, flows our river (Nile), when the cold becomes abundant. Now, where the clouds descend, the air grows thick and is filled with vapours which spread themselves as a veil not only over the sight, but over the intelligence."},{"heading":"(70%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"The east, my son Horos, is continually disturbed and glowing under the sunrise, as is the west under the sunset; there-fore, they who dwell in these regions can hardly preserve a clear perception. The north, by means of its icy temperature, thickens the mind even as it does the body. The central land alone, clear and serene, is favoured as are those who inhabit her."},{"heading":"(70%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"She brings forth in a perpetual tranquillity, she adorns and completes her offspring, she contends alone against all others, she triumphs, and like a worthy ruler partakes with the vanquished the fruits of victory. Explain to me further, my august Mother, what it is that causes in living men during long maladies, an alteration of discernment, of reason, even of the soul itself."},{"heading":"(70%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"And Isis answered: Among animals there are those who have affinity with fire, others with water, others with earth, others with air, others again with two or three elements, or with all the four. Or, inversely, some have an antipathy for fire, some for water, some for earth, some for air, or again for two, three or four elements."},{"heading":"(70%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"Thus, the locust and all kinds of insects flee from the fire; the eagle, the hawk, and other birds of flight fear the water; the fish dread the air and earth; the serpent abhors the open air, and like all crawling creatures loves the ground; all fishes delight in the deep, the birds in the air where they pass their lives; those who fly highest delight in the fire (of the sun) and sojourn in its vicinity."},{"heading":"(70%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"There are even certain creatures who disport themselves in the fire, such are the salamanders who have their abode in it. The elements enfold the body, and every soul inhabiting a body is weighed down and enchained by the four elements; wherefore, it is natural that the soul should have affinity with certain elements and aversion for others, for which reason she cannot enjoy perfect happiness."},{"heading":"(70%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"Nevertheless, as the soul is of divine origin, she struggles and meditates even beneath this bodily covering; but her thoughts are not what they would be if she were free from the body. And if the body be disturbed and troubled by sickness or by terror, the soul herself is tossed about like a man in the midst of tempestuous waves. PART III."},{"heading":"(70%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"Thou hast given me admirable instruction, O my most powerful Mother Isis, concerning the marvellous creation of Souls by God, and I am filled with wonder; but thou hast not yet shewn me whither souls depart when set free from bodies. Fain would I contemplate this mystery, and thank only thee for the initiation. And Isis said: Hearken, my son, for thy most necessary enquiry holds an important place, and may not be neglected. Hear my reply."},{"heading":"(70%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"O great and marvellous scion of the illustrious Osiris, think not that souls on quitting the body mix themselves confusedly in the vague immensity and become dispersed in the universal and infinite spirit, without power to return into bodies, to preserve their identity, or to seek again their primeval abode. Water spilt from a vase returns no more to its place therein, it has no proper locality, it mingles itself with the mass of waters; but it is not thus with souls, O most wise Horos."},{"heading":"(70%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"I am initiated into the mysteries of the immortal nature; I walk in the ways of the truth, and I will reveal all to thee without the least omission. And first I will tell thee that water, being a body without reason, composed of myriads of fluid particles, differs from the soul which is, my son, a personal entity, the royal work of the hands and of the mind of God, abiding herself in intelligence."},{"heading":"(70%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"That which proceeds from Unity, and not from multiplicity, cannot mingle with other things, and in order that the soul may be joined to the body, God subjects this harmonious union to Necessity. Souls do not, then, return confusedly, nor by chance, into one and the same place, but each is despatched into the condition which belongs to her. And this is deter-mined by that which the soul experiences while yet she is in the tenement of the body, loaded with a burden contrary to her nature."},{"heading":"(80%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"Hear: therefore, this comparison, O beloved Horos; suppose that there should be shut up in the same prison, men, eagles, doves, swans, hawks, swallows, sparrows, flies, serpents, lions, leopards, wolves, dogs, hares, oxen, sheep, and certain amphibious animals, such as seals, hydras, turtles, crocodiles, and that at the same moment all the creatures should be liberated."},{"heading":"(80%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"All at once would escape; the men would seek cities and the public places, the eagles the ether, where nature teaches them to live, the doves the lower air, the hawks the higher expanse; the swallows would repair to places frequented by men, the sparrows to the orchards, the swans to districts where they could sing; the flies would haunt the proximity of the ground as high only as human exhalations extend, for the property of flies is to live on these and to flit over the surface of the earth; the lions and leopards would flee to the mountains, the wolves to the solitudes; the dogs would follow the track of man; the hares would betake themselves to the woods, the oxen to the fields and meadows, the sheep to the pastures; the serpents would seek the caves of the earth; the seals and the turtles would rejoin their kind in the shallows and running waters, in order to enjoy, conformably to their nature, alike the proximity of the shore and of the deep."},{"heading":"(80%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"Each creature would return, conducted by its own interior discernment, into the abode befitting it. Even so every soul, whether human or inhabiting the earth under other conditions, knows whither she ought to go; unless, indeed, some son of Typhon should pretend that a bull may subsist in the waters or a turtle in the air."},{"heading":"(80%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"If, then, even when immersed in flesh and blood, souls do not infringe the law of order, although under penance, for union with the body is a penance, how much more shall they conform thereto when delivered from their bonds and set at liberty! Now this most holy law, which extends even unto heaven, is on this wise, O illustrious child: behold the hierarchy of souls! The expanse between the empyrean and the moon is occupied by the Gods, the stars, and the powers of providence."},{"heading":"(80%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"Between the moon and ourselves, my son, is the abode of the souls. The unmeasured air, which we call the wind, has in itself an appointed way in which it moves to refresh the earth, as I shall by and by relate. But this movement of the air upon itself impedes not the way of the souls, nor does it hinder them from ascending and descending without obstacle; they flow across the air without mingling in it, or confounding themselves therewith, as water flows over oil."},{"heading":"(80%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"This expanse, my son, is divided into four provinces, and into sixty regions. The first province from the earth upwards comprehends four regions, and extends as far as certain summits or promontories, which it is unable to transcend. The second province comprises eight regions in which the motions of the winds arise. Be thou attentive, my son, for thou hearest the ineffable mysteries of the earth, the heavens, and of the sacred fluid which lies between."},{"heading":"(80%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"1 In the province of the winds fly the birds; above this there is no moving air nor any creature. But the air with all the beings it contains distributes itself into all boundaries within its reach, and into the four quarters of the earth, while the earth cannot lift itself into the mansions of the air. The third province comprehends sixteen regions filled with a pure and subtle element."},{"heading":"(80%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"The fourth contains thirty-two regions, in which the air, wholly subtle and diaphanous, allows itself to be penetrated by the element of fire. Such is the order which, without confusion, reigns from depth to height; to wit, four general divisions, twelve intervals, sixty regions, and in these dwell the souls, each according to the nature thereof."},{"heading":"(80%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"They are indeed all of one substance, but they constitute a hierarchy; and the further any region is removed from the earth, the loftier is the dignity of the souls which dwell therein. And now it remains to be explained to thee, O most glorious Horos, what souls they are who abide in each of these regions, and this I shall set forth, beginning by the most exalted. The expanse which stretches between earth and heaven is divided into regions, my son Horos, according to measure and harmony."},{"heading":"(80%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"To these regions our ancestors have given various names; some call them zones, others firmaments, others spheres. Therein dwell the souls who are freed from bodies, and those who have not yet been incorporated. The stations which they occupy correspond with their dignity. In the upper region are the divine and royal souls; the baser souls they who float over the surface of the earth are in the lowest sphere, and in the middle regions are the souls of ordinary degree."},{"heading":"(80%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"Thus, my son, the souls destined to rule descend from the superior zones, and when they are delivered from the body, thither they return, or even higher still, unless indeed they have acted contrary to the dignity of their nature and to the laws of God."},{"heading":"(80%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"For, if they have transgressed, the Providence on high causes them to descend into the lower regions according to the measure of their faults; and in like manner also it conducts other souls, inferior in power and dignity, from the lower spheres into a more exalted abode. For on high dwell two ministers of the universal Providence; one is guardian of the souls, the other is their conductor, who sends them forth and ordains for them bodies."},{"heading":"(80%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"The first minister guards them, the second releases or binds them, according to the will of God. In this wise the law of equity presides over the changes which take place above, even as upon earth also it moulds and constructs the vessels in which the souls are immured. This law is supplemented by two energies, Memory and Experience."},{"heading":"(80%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"Memory directs in Nature the preservation and maintenance of all the original types appointed in heaven; the function of Experience is to provide every soul descending into generation with a body appropriate thereto; so that passionate souls should have vigorous bodies; slothful souls sluggard bodies; active souls active bodies; gentle souls gentle bodies; powerful souls powerful bodies; cunning souls dexterous bodies; briefly, that every soul should have a befitting nature."},{"heading":"(90%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"For it is not without just cause that winged creatures are clothed with feathers; that intelligent creatures are gifted with finer senses and superior to others; that beasts of the field are furnished with horns, with tusks, with claws, or other weapons; that reptiles are endowed with undulating and flexible bodies, and lest the moisture of their natures should render them feeble, are armed either with teeth or with pointed scales, so that they are, even less than others, in peril of death."},{"heading":"(90%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"As for fishes, these timid souls have allotted to them for a dwelling-place that element in which light is bereft of its double activity, for in the water, fire neither illuminates nor burns. Each fish, swimming by the help of his spiny fins, flies where he wills, and his weakness is protected by the obscurity of the deep."},{"heading":"(90%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"Thus are souls immured in bodies resembling themselves; in human shape, those souls who have received reason; in flying creatures, souls of a wild nature; in beasts, souls without reason, whose only law is force; in reptiles, deceitful souls, for they attack not their prey face to face, but by ambush; while fishes enshrine those timid souls who merit not the enjoyment of other elements. In every order of animals there are individuals who transgress the laws of their being. In what way, my Mother?"},{"heading":"(90%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"said Horos. And Isis answered: In this wise: A man who acts against reason, a beast which eludes necessity, a reptile which forgets its cunning, a fish which loses its timidity, a bird which renounces freedom. Thou hast heard what was to be said concerning the hierarchy of souls, their descent, and the creation of bodies."},{"heading":"(90%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"O my son, in every order of souls there are found a few royal souls, and of divers characters: some fiery, some cold, some proud, some gentle, some crafty, some simple, some contemplative, some active. This diversity belongs to the regions from whence they descend into bodies. From the royal zone the royal souls go forth, but there are many royalties; the royalty of spirit, of the flesh, of art, of science, of the virtues. And how, said Horos, dost thou name these royalties?"},{"heading":"(90%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"O my son, the king of souls who have hitherto existed is thy father Osiris; the king of bodies is the prince of each nation, he who governs. The king of wisdom is the Father of all things; the Initiator is the thrice great Hermes; over medicine presides Asclepios, the son of Hephaistos; force and power are under the sway of Osiris, and after him, under thine, my son. Philosophy depends on Arnebaskenis; poetry, yet again, on Asclepios, Imouthè’s son."},{"heading":"(90%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"So that, if thou thinkest thereon, thou wilt perceive that there are indeed many royalties and many kings. But the supreme royalty belongs to the highest region; lesser kingships correspond to the spheres which bring them forth. Those who issue from the fiery zone handle fire; those who come from the watery zone frequent liquid spheres; from the region of art and learning those are born who devote themselves to art and science; from the region of inactivity, those who live in ease and idleness."},{"heading":"(90%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"All that is done and said upon earth has its origin in the heights, from whence all essences are dispensed with measure and equilibrium; nor is there anything which does not emanate from above and return thither. Explain to me this that thou sayest, O my Mother. And Isis answered: An evident token of these exchanges has been stamped on all creatures by most holy Nature."},{"heading":"(90%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"The breath which we indraw from the upper air we exhale and again inbreathe by means of the lungs within us which perform this work. And when the way destined to receive our breath is closed, then no longer do we remain on earth; we depart hence. Moreover, O my glorious son, there are other accidents by which the balance of our combination may be destroyed. What is, then, this combination, O my Mother?"},{"heading":"(90%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"It is the union and admixture of the four elements, whence emanates a vapour which envelops the soul, penetrates into the body and communicates to both its own character. Thus are produced varieties among souls and bodies. If in the composition of a body, fire dominates, then the soul being already of an ardent nature, receives thereby an excess of heat which renders it the more energetic and furious, and the body the more vivacious and active."},{"heading":"(90%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"If the air dominates, the body and soul of the creature are thereby rendered unstable, errant and restless. The domination of the water causes the soul to be mild, affable, bland, sociable, and easily moulded, because water blends and mixes itself readily with all other things, dissolves them if it be abundant, moistens and penetrates them if it be less in quantity."},{"heading":"(90%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"A body softened by too much humidity offers but a weak resistance, a slight malady disintegrates it, and little by little dissolves its cohesion. Again, if the earthy element be dominant, the soul is obtuse, because the body lacks subtlety, nor can she force a way through the density of its organism. Therefore, the soul remains indrawn upon herself, borne down by the burden she supports, and the body is solid, inactive, and heavy, moving only with effort."},{"heading":"(90%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"But if the elements be all in just equilibrium, then the whole nature is ardent in its actions, subtle in its motions, fluent in its sensations, and of a robust constitution. Of the predominance of air and fire birds are born, whose nature resembles that of the elements which generate them. Men are endowed with an abundance of fire united with but a little air, and of water and earth equal parts."},{"heading":"(90%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"This excess of fire becomes sagacity, seeing that intelligence is indeed a kind of flame, which consumes not, but which penetrates. The predominance of water and earth with a sufficient admixture of air and but little fire engenders beasts; those endued with more fire than the rest are the more courageous."},{"heading":"(100%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"Water and earth in equal quantities give birth to reptiles, which, being deprived of fire, have neither courage nor truthfulness, while the excess of water renders them cold, that of earth, sordid and heavy, and the lack of air makes all their movements difficult."},{"heading":"(100%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"Much water with but little earth produces fishes; the absence of fire and air in them causes their timidity, and disposes them to lie hidden, while the predominance of water and earth in their nature approximates them by natural affinity to earth dissolved in water. Moreover, by means of the proportional increase of the elements composing the body is the body itself increased, and its development ceases when the full measure is attained."},{"heading":"(100%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"And so long, my beloved son, as equilibrium is maintained in the primitive combination and in the vapours arising therefrom, that is, so long as the normal proportion of fire, air, earth, and water remains unchanged, the creature continues in health."},{"heading":"(100%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"But if the elements deviate from the proportion originally determined (I speak not now of the growth of activities, nor of that resulting from a change of order, but of a rupture of equilibrium whether by addition or diminution of fire or of other elements) then malady supervenes. And should air and fire, whose nature is one with that of the soul itself, prevail in the conflict, then, through the dominance of those elements, destroyers of the flesh, the creature abandons its proper state."},{"heading":"(100%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"For the earthy element is the pabulum of the body, and the water wherewith it is permeated contributes to consolidate it; but it is the aerial element which confers motion, and the fire engenders all energies. The vapours produced by the union and combination of these elements blending with the soul, as it were by fusion, bear her along with them, and clothe her in their own nature, whether good or evil. So long as she remains in this natural association the soul keeps the rank she has attained."},{"heading":"(100%)","title":"The Virgin of The World","content":"But if a change should occur either in the combination itself or in any of its parts or subdivisions, the vapours, altering their condition, alter likewise the relations between soul and body; the fire and air, aspiring upward, draw with them the soul, their sister, while the watery and terrestrial elements, which tend earthwards like the body, weigh it down and overwhelm it."}]
